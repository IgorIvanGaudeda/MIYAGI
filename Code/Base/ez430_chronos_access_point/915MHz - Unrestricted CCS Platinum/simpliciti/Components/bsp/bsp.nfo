    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	<NONE>

extern void BSP_Init() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 15 units)
    It has 4 non-trivial scope blocks nested 4 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	__disable_interrupt() (1 times)
	BSP_InitDrivers() (1 times)
	BSP_InitBoard() (1 times)

extern void BSP_InitBoard() is called from 1 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 20 units)

extern void BSP_InitLeds() is called from 1 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 7 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	<NONE>

extern int _system_pre_init() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 5 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	<NONE>

Address of global variable is never taken:
	static unsigned char sIterationsPerUsec



These functions may be recursive:
	BSP_Init()

Making this function inlineable: BSP_InitLeds()

Making this function inlineable: BSP_InitDrivers()

These external functions are called but not defined here:
	__disable_interrupt()
