extern void wbsl_SpiWriteTxFifo() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 7 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	spiBurstFifoAccess() (1 times)


These functions may be recursive:
	wbsl_SpiCmdStrobe()
	wbsl_SpiReadReg()
	wbsl_SpiReadRxFifo()
	wbsl_SpiWriteReg()
	spiRegAccess()
	wbsl_SpiWriteTxFifo()
	spiBurstFifoAccess()

Results of interprocedural value propagation:

   static void spiBurstFifoAccess() has these parameter attributes:
      unsigned char addrByte :  addrByte%0x80u == 127u;  addrByte <= 0xffu;  addrByte >= 127u;

These external functions are called but not defined here:
	__disable_interrupt()
	__get_interrupt_state()
	__set_interrupt_state()
