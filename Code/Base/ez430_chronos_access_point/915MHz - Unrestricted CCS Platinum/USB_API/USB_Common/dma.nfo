extern void *memcpyV() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	<NONE>

ADVICE: In function memcpyV() in ../USB_API/USB_Common/dma.c
	in the 'for' loop with loop variable 'i' at lines ../USB_API/USB_Common/dma.c:56-60
	for the statement *&bTmp = ((unsigned char *)source)[i]; at line 58
	and the statement ((unsigned char *)dest)[i] = *&bTmp; at line 59

	Consider declaring 'source' as const void * const restrict source
	or declaring 'dest' as  void * const restrict dest
	to assert that 'source' in the address of ((unsigned char *)source)[i];
	and            'dest' in the address of ((unsigned char *)dest)[i];
	do not access the same object in memory.
