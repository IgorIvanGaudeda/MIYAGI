		======File-level Analysis Summary======


extern unsigned cdcReceiveDataInBuffer() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 28 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	USBCDC_receiveData() (1 times)
	USBCDC_bytesInUSBBuffer() (1 times)

extern unsigned char cdcSendDataInBackground() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 46 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	USBCDC_sendData() (1 times)
	USBCDC_intfStatus() (1 times)

extern unsigned char cdcSendDataWaitTilDone() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 58 units)
    It has 4 non-trivial scope blocks nested 4 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	USBCDC_intfStatus() (1 times)
	USBCDC_sendData() (1 times)


These functions may be recursive:
	cdcReceiveDataInBuffer()
	cdcSendDataInBackground()
	cdcSendDataWaitTilDone()

These external functions are called but not defined here:
	USBCDC_intfStatus()
	USBCDC_sendData()
	USBCDC_bytesInUSBBuffer()
	USBCDC_receiveData()
