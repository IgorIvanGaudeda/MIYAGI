		======File-level Analysis Summary======


extern unsigned char sCB() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 18 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	<NONE>

extern void simpliciti_main() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	__set_interrupt_state() (1 times)
	__disable_interrupt() (1 times)
	__get_interrupt_state() (1 times)
	SMPL_LinkListen() (1 times)
	memcpy() (1 times)
	SMPL_Send() (1 times)
	SMPL_Receive() (1 times)
	UART_send_async() (1 times)
	SMPL_Ioctl() (1 times)
	SMPL_Init() (1 times)
	BSP_Init() (1 times)

Address of global variable is never taken:
	static unsigned char sNumCurrentPeers



These functions may be recursive:
	simpliciti_main()

These external functions are called but not defined here:
	memcpy()
	BSP_Init()
	SMPL_Init()
	SMPL_Ioctl()
	UART_send_async()
	SMPL_Receive()
	SMPL_Send()
	SMPL_LinkListen()
	__get_interrupt_state()
	__disable_interrupt()
	__set_interrupt_state()
